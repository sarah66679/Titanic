 # Project 2: part 2 'Titanic'
 ## Problem Statment:
 In this competition, we have a data set of different information about passengers onboard the Titanic,
 and we see if we can use that information to predict whether those people survived or not.
 ## Executive Summary:
 We started this competition by focusing on getting a well understanding of the dataset.
 The EDA is detailed and many visualizations are included. Then we provide Seven kind of modeling in order to reach to best predections.
 Gradient Boosting Classifier performs best with a score of 0.78.
 
 ## Datasets Description:

# Conclusion :

In this competition, we have a data set of different information about passengers onboard the Titanic,
and we see if we can use that information to predict whether those people survived or not.
We started this competition by focusing on getting a well understanding of the dataset. 
The EDA is detailed and many visualizations are included. Then we provide Seven kind of modeling Logistic Regression,
DecisionTreeClassifier, SVC, Random Forest Classifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier :
in order to reach to best predections. Gradient Boosting Classifier performs best with a score of 0.78.
